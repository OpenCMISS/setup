OpenCMISS Libraries Setup Build Script
======================================

The main purpose of this setup script is to simplify the installation of the OpenCMISS libraries, by design it is limited in the configurability it offers.  If you need to change settings that are not available directly through this script then consider a more advanced installation.  A more advanced installation can be achieved through the use of this setup script, to create the initial environment for the build, and a manual configuration of the build, using the much more configurable manage script.  Alternatively, you can manually create an installation from scratch.
